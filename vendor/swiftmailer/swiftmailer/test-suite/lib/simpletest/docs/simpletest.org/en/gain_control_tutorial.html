		<h1>Taking control of testing</h1>

		<p>
                In order to test a code module you need very tight control
                of its environment.
                If anything can vary behind the scenes, for example a
                configuration file, then this could cause the tests
                to fail unexpectedly.
                This would not be a fair test of the code and could
                cause you to spend fruitless hours examining code that
                is actually working, rather than dealing with the configuration issue
                that actually failed the test.
                At the very least your test cases get more complicated in
                taking account the possible variations.
            </p><a name="time"></a><h2>Controlling time</h2><p>
                There are often a lot of obvious variables that could affect
                a unit test case, especially in the web development
                environment in which PHP usually operates.
                These include database set up, file permissions, network
                resources and configuration amongst others.
                The failure or misinstall of one of these components will
                break the test suite.
            </p><p>
                Do we add tests to confirm these components are installed?
                This is a good idea, but if you place them into code module
                tests you will start to clutter you test code with detail
                that is irrelavent to the immediate task.
                They should be placed in their own test suite.
            </p><p>
                Another problem, though, is that our development machines
                must have every system component installed to be able
                to run the test suite.
                Your tests run slower too.
            </p><p>
                When faced with this while coding we will often create wrapper
                versions of classes that deal with these resources.
                Ugly details of these resources are then coded once only.
                I like to call these classes "gateway classes",
                as they exist at the edges of the application, 
                the interface of your application with the rest of the
                system.
                These gateway classes are best simulated during testing
                by fake versions.
                These run faster and are often called
                "Server Stubs", or in more generic form
                "Mock Objects".
                It is a great time saver to wrap and stub out such resources.
            </p><p>
                One often neglected external resource is time.
            </p><p>
                For example, to test a session time-out coders will often
                temporarily set the session time limit to a small value, say two seconds,
                and then do a <code>sleep(3)</code>
                and assert that the session is now invalid.
                That adds three seconds to your test suite and is usually
                a lot of extra code making your session classes that maleable.
                Far simpler is to have a way to suddenly advance the clock.
                To control time.
            </p><a name="clock"></a><h2>A clock class</h2><p>
                We will again design our clock wrapper by first writing tests.
                We add a clock test case to our <em>tests/all_tests.php</em>
                test suite...
</p><pre>
<?php
require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . '/simpletest/autorun.php');
require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . '/log_test.php');
require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . '/clock_test.php');

class AllTests extends TestSuite {
    function __construct() {
        parent::__construct();
        $this->addTest(new TestOfLogging());<strong>
        $this->addTest(new TestOfClock());</strong>
    }
}
?>
</pre><p>
                Then we create the test case in the new file
                <em>tests/clock_test.php</em>...
</p><pre>
<?php
require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . '/../classes/clock.php');
<strong>
class TestOfClock extends UnitTestCase {
    function testClockTellsTime() {
        $clock = new Clock();
        $this->assertEqual($clock->now(), time());
    }
}</strong>
?>
</pre><p>
                Our only test at the moment is that our new
                <code>Clock</code> class acts
                as a simple PHP <code>time()</code>
                function substitute.
                We will write the time shift functionality once we are green.
                At the moment we are obviously not green...
                <div class="demo">
                    <br/>
                    <b>Fatal error</b>:  Failed opening required '../classes/clock.php' (include_path='') in
                    <b>/home/marcus/projects/lastcraft/tutorial_tests/tests/clock_test.php</b> on line <b>2</b>
                    <br/>
                </div>
                We create a <em>classes/clock.php</em> file...
</p><pre>
<strong><?php
class Clock {
    function now() {
    }
}
?></strong>
</pre><p>
                This regains our flow ready for coding.
                <div class="demo">
                    <h1>AllTests</h1>
                    <span class="fail">Fail</span>: TestOfClock -&gt; testClockTellsTime -&gt; [NULL: ] should be equal to [integer: 1050257362]<br/>
                    <div style="padding: 8px; margin-top: 1em; background-color: red; color: white;">3/3 test cases complete.
                    <strong>4</strong> passes, <strong>1</strong> fails and <strong>0</strong> exceptions.</div>
                </div>
                This is now easy to fix...
</p><pre>
class Clock {
    function now() {<strong>
        return time();</strong>
    }
}
</pre><p>
                And we are green...
                <div class="demo">
                    <h1>AllTests</h1>
                    <div style="padding: 8px; margin-top: 1em; background-color: green; color: white;">3/3 test cases complete.
                    <strong>5</strong> passes, <strong>0</strong> fails and <strong>0</strong> exceptions.</div>
                </div>
                There is still a problem.
            </p><p>
                The clock could roll over during the assertion causing the
                result to be out by one second.
                The chances are small, but if there were a lot of timing tests
                you would end up with a test suite that is erratic, severely
                limiting its usefulness.
                We will <a href="subclass_tutorial.html">tackle this shortly</a> and for now just jot it onto our
                "to do" list.
            </p><p>
                The advancement test looks like this...
</p><pre>
class TestOfClock extends UnitTestCase {

    function testClockTellsTime() {
        $clock = new Clock();
        $this->assertEqual($clock->now(), time());
    }
    <strong>
    function testClockAdvance() {
        $clock = new Clock();
        $clock->advance(10);
        $this->assertEqual($clock->now(), time() + 10);
    }</strong>
}
</pre><p>
                The code to get to green is straight forward and just involves adding
                a time offset.
</p><pre>
class Clock {<strong>
    private $offset = 0;</strong>
    
    function now() {
        return time()<strong> + $this->offset</strong>;
    }
    <strong>
    function advance($offset) {
        $this->offset += $offset;
    }</strong>
}
</pre><p>
            </p><a name="tidy"></a><h2>Test suite tidy up</h2><p>
                Our <em>all_tests.php</em> file has some repetition we could
                do without.
                We have to manually add our test cases from each included
                file.
                It is possible to remove it, but use of the following requires care.
                The <code>TestSuite</code> class has a
                convenience method called <code>addFile()</code>
                that takes a PHP file as a parameter.
                This mechanism makes a note of all the classes, requires in the
                file and then has a look at any newly created classes.
                If they are descendents of <code>SimpleTestCase</code>
                they are added as a new <code>TestSuite</code>.
            </p><p>
                Here is our refactored test suite using this method...
</p><pre>
<?php<strong>
require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . '/simpletest/autorun.php');</strong>
    
class AllTests extends TestSuite {
    function AllTests() {
        parent::__construct();<strong>
        $this->addFile('log_test.php');
        $this->addFile('clock_test.php');</strong>
    }
}
?>
</pre><p>
                The pitfalls of this are...
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        If the test file has already been included,
                        no new classes will be added to this group
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the test file has other classes that are
                        related to <code>SimpleTestCase</code>
                        then these will be added to the group test as well.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                In practice neither of these turn out to be problems.
                Test suites are usually a tree structure.
                It's rare to need a test case in two places.
                As for extra classes being included, they have to be
                descendents of <code>SimpleTestCase</code>.
                These are likely to be superclasses of helper code
                for several other tests.
                Simply marking them as <code>abstract</code> is
                enough to stop them being run.
            </p><p>
                We should really fix the glitch with the possible
                clock rollover so we'll
